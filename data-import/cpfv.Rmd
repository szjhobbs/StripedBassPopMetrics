Load data and then subset for Striped Bass only.
`SpeciesCode`  
- 335: Bass-Striped

```{r load-data}

dir_dat <- "~/RProjects/1_DataFiles"
date_extract <- "01302019" # as mmddyyyy
file_name <- paste0("MLS_Extract_", date_extract, ".csv")

  # UTF-8-BOM removes Ã¯.. from first column name
  fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# subset for sturgeon only
LogData <- subset(LogData, subset = SpeciesCode %in% 335)

# convert LogDate field to Date class

Using package `dplyr` for ease of creating annual summary. Here we summarize CPFV data for blocks east of the Golden Gate and only for successful (i.e., at least one angler caught & kept at least one sturgeon) trips.

```{r annual-summary}

sfe_successful <- LogData %>% 
  filter(
    Block %in% blocks_sfe &
      NumberKept > 0 &
      SpeciesCode %in% 335
  ) %>% 
  group_by(Year = LogYear) %>% 
  summarise(
    Trips = length(SerialNumber),
    Hours = sum(HoursFished, na.rm = TRUE),
    Anglers = sum(NumberOfFishers),
    AnglerHours = sum(HoursFished * NumberOfFishers, na.rm = TRUE),
    NumKept = sum(NumberKept),
    CPUE = (NumKept / AnglerHours) * 100
  )

```

```{r save-data}

# save to this directory
dr <- "data/cpfv"

saveRDS(object = sfe_successful, file = file.path(dr, "SFESuccessful.rds"))
# saveRDS(object = , file = file.path(dr, ".rds"))

```

```{r log-extract}

dt <- as.Date(date_extract, format = "%m%d%Y")
dbn <- "Marine Logs Website (CPFV database)"

write(
  sprintf("data extracted & cleaned: %s \nfrom %s", dt, dbn),
  file = file.path(dr, "data-log"),
  append = FALSE
)
