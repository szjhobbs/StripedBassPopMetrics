Never finished .Rmd and ended up just putting data in .xlsx with pivot tables

On 18-May-2018, Marty requested summary catch data for "3rd week in May" in search of justification to end tagging early. I was attempting to summarize in .Rmd file but got frustrated with the process and just dumped it to Excel.

Request was "For 2004-2017 fyke trapping, this morning would you let me know (1) the annual min and max SB/week during 3rd week of May and (2) the overall average, min, and max SB/week during 3rd week of May?"

Again, never finished the .Rmd file, but this could be an intersting summary and show how few days we now devote to this project.
