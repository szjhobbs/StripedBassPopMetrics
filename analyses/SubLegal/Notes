Per Marty's e-mail...

"Tagging sub-legals was mostly a pilot effort to see what we could learn about C&R, with a faint hope we could also get at mortality and abundance of that demographic.  We've done it long enough (starting 2010) that it's time to summarize and crunch those numbers.  Let's shoot for doing that in June."

this analysis will look at sub-legals tagged (when we started doing this ~2010 or 2011) and those fish recaptured to see how many anglers have caught, reported tagged, then released

Per Marty's request...

need to calculate annual abundance, survival (Ricker), and 'C&R' rate for sub-legals.

Might be best to make a table (by year) of M, C, R, R1, M2, R12, and R22 or something like that...then make the various estimates from that table
