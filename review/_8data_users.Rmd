## Primary Users

Mostly, we are the primary users. Over the last decade, a few entities have requested data subsets but none have done so at regular intervals (e.g., annually). We supply (or should supply) annual estimates of harvest rate, survival rate, abundance (absolute & relative), and harvest. Alas, we have fallen short in our timeliness of calculating such metrics.

<more here, other users?>

## Customer (User) Needs

Loboschefsky et al. (citation) used abundance estimates to develop a bioenergetics model.
